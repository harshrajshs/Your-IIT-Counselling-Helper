                        <p>It appears that the opening ranks for new IITs have been decreasing in past few years,

                            more accessible to a wider range of students.

                            This trend could be due to a number of factors, including increased investment in
                            infrastructure and facilities at
                            these institutions, as well as efforts to expand the pool of students from which they

                            attracting high-performing students, as well as

        <h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Conclusion and Final Thoughts</h1>
        <p class="card" style="width: 90%; height: 25vh;">Choosing between an Old IIT or a New IIT depends on a variety
            of factors.
            <br><br>
            Based on our analysis,
            if you're
            more focused
            on research and academics, an old IIT might be a better fit. However, if you're looking for more diverse
            cultural
            experiences and unique opportunities, new IITs offer the same IIT brand experience on a modern
            infrastructure.
